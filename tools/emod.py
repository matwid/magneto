    Defines a job.

    Methods:

        start():        starts the job
        stop(timeout):  stops the job
        _run():         actual function that is run in a thread

    Data:

        priority:   priority of the job (used by a job manager to schedule the job)
        state:      shows the current state of the job, 'idle', 'run' or 'wait'

      In the current execution model, a job should be re-startable.
    I.e., when a job is stopped before it is finished, upon next
    start, the work should be continued e.g. previously acquired
    data should be kept and accumulated.

      It is the user's task to ensure that previous data is
    handled correctly and to decide when a job should be continued
    and when it should be restarted as a new measurement.

      A job can be in one of three states 'idle': doing nothing,
    'run': running, 'wait': waiting to be executed. The latter state
    is typically set by a Job manager to show that the job is
    scheduled for execution. The
